## How does it work?
The hero (user) must chase the monster and try to trap it against the trees. They must drive it out of the combat area within a certain time frame marked by the timer.

- The hero and the monster will engage in a sort of game of tag, in which case the monster must flee from the hero to avoid being killed;
- The monster wins when the hero's time to kill it runs out, and the hero wins when he kills the monster;
- The monster will keep running away from the hero until the hero forces it out of the combat area.

You can play using the keyboard (up, down, left, and right keys).
